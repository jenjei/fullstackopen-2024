This project's frontend is cloned from here: https://github.com/jenjei/patientor (forked repository)

I have no clue why I cannot commit forked and cloned repositories properly? Git was suggesting to `git submodule add <url> part9-typescript/patientor/frontend` ??? I tried to remove .git folder in /frontend/patientor but didn't solve this problem.

Locally I have the frontend as supposed and it is working correctly.

So, works on my machine 8)
