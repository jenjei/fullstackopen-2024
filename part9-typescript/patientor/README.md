This project's frontend is forked here: https://github.com/jenjei/patientor

I have no clue why I cannot commit forked and cloned repositories properly? Git was suggesting to git submodule add <url> part9-typescript/patientor/frontend ???

Locally I have the frontend as supposed and it is working correctly.
